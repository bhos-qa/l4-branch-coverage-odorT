## Statement coverage
Statement coverage refers to executing individual
program statements and observing the outcome.
We say that 100% statement coverage has been
achieved if all the statements have been
executed at least once. Complete statement
coverage is the weakest coverage criterion in
program testing. Any test suite that achieves less
than statement coverage for new software is
considered to be unacceptable.

## Branch coverage
Covering a branch means
selecting a path that includes the branch.
Complete branch coverage means selecting
a number of paths such that every branch is
included in at least one path.

## Predicate coverage
If all possible combinations of truth values
of the conditions affecting a selected path
have been explored under some tests,
then we say that predicate coverage has
been achieved.
